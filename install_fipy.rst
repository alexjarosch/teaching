Install Fipy
============

We will use the finite volume package FiPy for our upcoming classes. FiPy works best with a Python 2.7 interpreter, so we are going to switch to a 2.7 environment. Our existing finite difference models work anyhow with 2.7 as well.

In this manual I consider three different install scenarios, so look for the headline that fits your case the most.

---------------------------------------

Simple and easy, I have already pre-installed the miniconda environment for you, running a Python 2.7 environment with FiPy ready. All you have to do is change the PATH variable in your .bashrc. So open up a new terminal (shell) window and start editing your .bashrc:

    nano -w .bashrc
